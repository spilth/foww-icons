# Fallout: Wasteland Warfare Icons

This is a collection of icons for the game [Fallout: Wasteland Warfare](https://www.modiphius.net/pages/fallout-wasteland-warfare) created by [Modiphius Entertainment](https://modiphius.net/). They are provided in the Scalable Vector Format (SVG) so that they can be used at any size without losing quality.

## Development Setup

To check out the project and generate the icons, do the following:

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:spilth/foww-icons.git
$ bundle
$ rake
```

This will generate the SVG icons and an HTML page in an `output` directory.
